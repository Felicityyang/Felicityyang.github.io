<a id="felicity-yang-september-26-2015" class="anchor" href="#felicity-yang-september-26-2015" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a> I went to Alumni Cook Out in ILR yesterday. There were buffet served and those were about the same as Johnson's one for lunch. I had a quick dinner and left the spot, and back home by bus. Helen was just out and I didn't take my keys. When I got home from the back yard Zoe just got up. She's home sleeping for the whole afternoon but Helen didn't know... Helen was in Kristen's home for serious talk and I don't know how's it yet. And I hope it's great! But anyway she had a long sleep last night!! And she's going to watch the movie about rock climbing?
